			<p>Paycheck frequencies, wages, and the need for liquidity of workers in the U.S. [<a href="papers/Hoang_JMP.pdf">JMP</a>]  <br>
			<em>November 2022</em> <br>
			 <em>Abstract:</em> American workers who receive weekly paychecks tend to earn lower hourly wages and have
less liquid wealth than those who are paid every two weeks. I explain these stylized facts by showing,
through a labor search model incorporating workers' liquid assets, that frequency serves as a compensating differential on the labor market. Workers with less liquidity are willing to accept jobs that
pay more frequently in exchange for lower wages, because the frequent payments help them smooth
their consumption within a month without the need to resort to expensive loans. The distribution
of liquidity in equilibrium plays a key role in underpinning the wage distributions conditional on
pay frequency. Calibrating the model to U.S. data, I find that administrative costs for processing each paycheck are around 2.6% of the median workers' weekly wage, explaining approximately 8% of the wage gap between weekly and biweekly earners.
